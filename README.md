# Hello!

This is a "simple" Rust implementation of DES. I made this to have a hackable version of DES I could cryptanalyze.

# Running

run `cargo test` to run test and `cargo run --release` to run the cryptanalysis (in src/bin/jupiter.rs). It's important to use `--release` as otherwise it will be build a debug build and be very slow.
